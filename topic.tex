Question 6: Flow State and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory Questionnaires
Design a set of questions based on Flow State and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory Questionnaires for your project/larger project as discussed in Lecture 8.

Discuss the potential cross-overs of the two systems with the items you have chosen, the rationales behind the chosen items and the process for customization of the items to address the identified queries for your own project. Implement and/or design an experimental future set up for your project where you would implement these questionnaires and discuss expected/actual outcomes.
